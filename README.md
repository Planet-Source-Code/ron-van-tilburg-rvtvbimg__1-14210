### Description

Ever saved a JPG or GIF you loaded into your App and then looked at the result? - this will fix that problem. This submission features capture of any GDI object on your app with a hDC (say Form or PictureBox), lets you do some simple image processing on it (eg. Flip or Resize), then allows you to colormap it, dither it and save it as a BMP or a GIF. Yes a GIF! Entirely coded in VB and presented as a DLL with extensive demo program, this could be the beginning of a great togetherware gfx processor. Contains OctTree color quantization and Remapping to MS,New or Fixed colormaps, with or without Dithering. Serious bug or idea submissions (with explain and code snippets) welcome.
